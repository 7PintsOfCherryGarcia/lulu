Title: Distribution based post clustering curation of amplicon data
Author: Julian Regalado
Maintainer: Julian Regalado <julian.perez@sund.ku.dk>
Description: The purpose of LULU is to reduce the number of erroneous OTUs in OTU tables to 
             achieve more realistic biodiversity metrics. By evaluating the co-occurence 
             patterns of OTUs among samples LULU identifies OTUs that consistently satisfy
             some user selected criteria for being errors of more abundant OTUs and merges
             these. It has been shown that curation with LULU consistently result in more 
             realistic diversity metrics. The required input of LULU is an OTU table and 
             a corresponding matchlist with all the internal matches of OTUs.
